SYNOPSIS
        unknown call_strict(object|string ob, string func, ...)

DESCRIPTION
        Similar to call_other(). Call a member function <fun> in another
        object <ob> if the function is defined and publicly accessible.
        Any of the optional extra arguments are passed to the function.
        Result is the value returned from the called function.

        If ob::fun does not define a publicly accessible function, the
        efun will call the H_DEFAULT_METHOD hook if set. If the hook
        is not set or can't resolve the call either, the efun will raise
        a runtime error.

        Calls to the master object never use the H_DEFAULT_METHOD hook.
        To force non-default calls, the efun call_direct_strict() can
        be used.

        ob can also be an object_name. If a string is passed for ob
        and an object with that name can't be found or loaded, an
        error occurs.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.6.2.

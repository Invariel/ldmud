SYNOPSIS
        unknown call_direct_strict(object|string ob, string func, ...)

DESCRIPTION
        Similar to call_other(). Call a member function <fun> in another
        object <ob> if the function is defined and publicly accessible.
        Any of the optional extra arguments are passed to the function.
        Result is the value returned from the called function.

        This efun is a twin to call_strict(), with the difference
        being that call_direct_strict() never calls a default method.

        Thus if ob::fun does not define a publicly accessible function,
        the efun will raise a runtime error.

        ob can also be an object_name. If a string is passed for ob
        and an object with that name can't be found or loaded, an
        error occurs.

HISTORY
        Introduced in LDMud 3.6.2.
